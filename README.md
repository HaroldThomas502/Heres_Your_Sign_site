# Heres_Your_Sign_site

Survey site to determine your sign

## Description

A responsive web site utilizing custom CSS  and JavaScript that surveys user and determines sign based on responses.

## Custom CSS Classes

The class(es) I created are:

1. .links

Defines screen width percentage, border attributes, padding and background color of links container.

2. .main

Defines screen width percentage, border attributes, padding and background color of main (survey) container.

3. .wrap

Utilizes flex-direction to reverse the stacking order of containers when page responds to a smaller window width.

## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. Get
This is a shorthand function for getElementByID.  Saw this used in Treehouse and realized that it can be useful sometimes to write smaller, cleaner, easier to read (and write) code.

2. checkReply

This function is used to loop through an array to determine the user's selection, then assign a numeric value for that selection and add it to a running total.
